	These analyses can help us understand the distribution of schools and the academic performance of students based on school types, school budget, their math/reading scores, and number of students. Further exploration and comparisons between different metrics, such as reading scores and passing rates, can provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of school types on student outcomes.

	From the calculations, we can see there are apparent funding disparities. The "Per Student Budget" column in the data frame shows that the charter schools have a lot more funding than the charter schools which in turn gives them more resources to achieve higher score in both math and reading. 

	These conclusions and comparisons provide valuable insights into funding disparities and academic performance, enabling further investigation and discussions on the impact of school types on student outcomes.
